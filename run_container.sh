# IMPORTANT NOTE:
#   - This file is necessary on the first run of a MOUSS_mini on a new system!!!
#   - However, <docker compose up> should be used in production situations
# This is a  file designed to help run the mouss_mini docker container
# to help rapid development. This run command uses a volume mount so that 
# changes in (only) /mouss_mini_ws are reflected on the host OS and the container.
